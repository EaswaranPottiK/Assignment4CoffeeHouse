Using * universal selector i have made margin and padding to 0 

I have also made box-sizing to border-box to avoid overflow of contents

inside body i have put background color to light pink

background url is used to put a background image on website 

background position is center so that we see image from center part and not any corners

background-repeat: when size of image is low compared to screensize, image is repeated to fill and entire page; to avoid this i have set this property as no-repeat 

height: i have given 31% of screen visible space

backgroud-size : image diamension might not match with diamension of the page so a part page might not be filled by image to avoid this image is streached to cover entire page 

this is achieved using background-size set to cover

box shadow is used to achieve halow effect; box shadow is specified in this format x dir, y direction , spread parameter, color

position sticky is used so that element stays in that position as long as scope of the parent element is there

top left are used to specify the position of the div 

with is the length of the input bar; height is the height of input bar 

border radius is used to make side of input bar rounded 

backgroud color is the color of text bar 

padding is the space between element and the box 

border is set to none to remove any border if present 

justify-content is the spacing property used in flex

dispaly is specified as flex so as to use flexbox 

flex direction is specified as color so that arrangement can be done coloumn wise 

text align is center so that text gets aligned in middle of parent div
